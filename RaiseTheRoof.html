<h4>THE HOUSING
CRISIS IS AN ISSUE
FOR EVERYONE
</h4>

<p>Most workers now struggle
to buy a home of their own
as house prices have
spiralled beyond the reach
of those on low and
average incomes.</p>

<p>Soaring rents have put huge
financialstrain on workers,
students and theirfamilies,
often paying for poor quality
accommodation with little
or no security of tenure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, housing waiting
lists grow everlonger and
homeless numbers are at
record levels. Thousands
are now crowded into
unsuitable accommodation,
with familiesforced to raise
children in hotelrooms and
other emergency dwellings.</p>

<p>Government policy to date
hasfailed to solve the crisis.
But on October 3 there is a
chance to change course,
when an opposition party
motion on the crisisis
debated in the DÃ¡il.</p>
