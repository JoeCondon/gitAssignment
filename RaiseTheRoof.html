<h4>THE HOUSING
CRISIS IS AN ISSUE
FOR EVERYONE
</h4>
<p> Merging trial </p>

<p>Most workers now struggle
to buy a home of their own
as house prices have
spiralled beyond the reach
of those on low and
average incomes.</p>

<p>Soaring rents have put huge
financialstrain on workers,
students and theirfamilies,
often paying for poor quality
accommodation with little
or no security of tenure.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, housing waiting
lists grow everlonger and
homeless numbers are at
record levels. Thousands
are now crowded into
unsuitable accommodation,
with familiesforced to raise
children in hotelrooms and
other emergency dwellings.</p>
